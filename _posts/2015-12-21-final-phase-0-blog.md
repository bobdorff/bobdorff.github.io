I’ve written for other people’s blogs and managed a few blogs of my own in the past, but those have all used existing CMS systems and none of those blogs featured much custom code. I really appreciate that I’ve learned how the different parts of a website function, and I genuinely feel like I have the freedom and capability to create any sort of site I’d like going forward. While it will take practice for me to develop my skills further, I have a strong foundation to build on. 

My favorite part of developing a blog was also the most difficult. The complete freedom afforded by site development is a blessing because it allows you to create the exact site you see in your mind. Unfortunately, it’s also a curse because you can spend hours making minor alterations to parts of the site that really don’t affect its functionality. It’s fun to make sites that are visually exciting and complex, but that may not be the best route if you want to make navigation easy for visitors. As I make sites in the future and revise this site further, I will try to focus even more intensely on creating a highly usable site that is also visually interesting. Things like navigation icons that always remain visible and easy-to-read font choices are simple to implement, and they can have a major impact on how a site is perceived.
