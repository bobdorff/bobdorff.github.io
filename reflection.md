_What did you learn about padding, borders and margins?_
	I found out a lot about when to use a margin vs. padding. They can have very similar effects in certain situations and drastically different effects in others, and extensive trial and error taught me when it was appropriate to use each of them. 

_What did you learn about CSS positioning?_
	There's no single way to lay things out on your site. Several different methods can achieve the same final result, so it's a matter of figuring out the _best_ way to do things rather than identifying a single "right" way.

_What aspects were easy/difficult to implement_
	Different types of link styling. I was very excited to create clean links that responded to clicks and hovers the way I wanted them to. The most difficult thing was understanding floats and making everything stay where I wanted during window resizing. The solution was relatively simple, but getting there was a journey.

_What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS?_
	Organization matters! The cleaner the code is for both CSS and HTML, the easier it is to see how things fit together. That's very useful when you return to a project after a few hours away.
