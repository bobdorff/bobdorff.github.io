				<h2>Map attack!<h2>
					<h4> 11/22/2015 </h4>

						I am not a cartographer, but today we're going to talk all about mapping. Specifically, we're going to delve into the <code>map</code> method that lives inside Ruby. This method is part of a larger module known as "Enumerables." A complete explination of modules and how they're used is beyond the scope of this blog post, but it's worth knowing that modules are collections methods that can be "mixed in" to your programs. Once you've mixed in a module like "Enumerable," you have access to a bunch of methods that will make your life easier. One of these incredibly useful methods is called <code>map</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Enumerable methods are used to manipulate collections of objects. When you use the <code>map</code> method, you instruct the computer to work through a collection of items and perform a specific code block on each item it comes across. Then, <code>map</code> returns a new array that contains the results of the code.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you've worked with arrays and hashes in Ruby before, you're probably thinking that <code>map</code> sounds a lot like <code>each</code>. These methods are similar, in that each allows you to work through a collection and modify the collection's contents with a block of code, but they return different things. When you use <code>each</code> on an array, the returned value is the original array. In contrast, <code>map</code> will return a new array that reflects the changes caused by your code block. 
					</p>
					<p>
						To drive this home, let's look at some examples. If we have the following array
						<p><code>
							array = [1, 2, 3]
						</p></code>
						<p>
							<code>map</code> and <code>each</code> will give different return values. 
						</p>
						<p><code>
							array.each { |item| item + 1 }
							<p>=> [1, 2, 3]</p>
						</p></code>
						<p>
						while
						</p>
						<code>
							array.map { |item| item + 1 }
							<p>=> [2, 3, 4]</p>
						</code>
					<p>
						It's important to recognize that the array <code>map</code> provides does not overwrite the original array. It's an entirely new entity. If you do want to overwrite the old array, however, Ruby will let you. With the <code>map!</code> method, you can modify an array's contents in place, and the original array (with newly altered values) will be returned.
