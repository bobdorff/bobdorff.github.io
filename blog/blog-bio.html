					<h2>Have you seen this man?</h2>
						<hr>
						You might call Bob Dorff a jack of all trades, but that would be a disservice to Jack, who's really good at a lot of things. Bob is a bob of all trades, and he's got a cursory knowledge of several fields. Bob's been a writer and a salesman professionally, and now he's learning how to develop web applications. Outside of his professional endevors, Bob's been known to write, take photos and draw the occasional cartoon. He also plays guitar, but he's currently having trouble finding a drummer in the Chicago area. <a href="blog-about.html">Let him know</a> if you have any leads.

						Bob graduated from Kenyon College, a tiny school located in his home state of Ohio. He studied English during his time there, spent countless hours doing print layout and graphic design for the school paper and wasted too much time listening to records with his friends. These days, Bob's on a constant treadmill to upgrade his stereo and get more CDs and records. The neighbors in his apartment building undoubtedly appreciate this quest.
