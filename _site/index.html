</h1>
<div class="entry-content"><p>
		Throughout the past eight weeks, recursion has lurked in the shadowy corners of our programming challenges, but I’ve never known exactly what recursion is or how it can be used in a programming context. It’s clear that recursion is important within programming, and I sensed that it might provide easier solutions to some of our challenges than the actual solutions I had created, but I had no understanding of what constituted a recursive statement. Today I did a bit of research into recursion, and it seems like a very simple concept with very complex implications for how programs can be structured. 
	</p>
	<p>
		On a very basic level, recursion is easy to understand. A routine that calls itself is recursive. That means a recursive statement contains itself and that statement contains itself, all the way to infinity. The best way I found to understand this concept is to think about a picture that contains someone holding a picture that is a replica of the picture you’re looking at. Inside that picture, there’s a smaller version of the picture you’re looking at and within that smaller picture there’s an even smaller version of the image. This demonstrates both the structure of recursive statements and a potential issue with recursion. If a statement calls itself, how will it ever <i>stop</i> calling itself?
	</p>
	<h3>
		The Base Case
	</h3>
	<p>
		A statement will stop calling itself when it reaches the “base case.” Whenever you create a recursive statement, you must also create a base case that will end the recursion, otherwise the statement will call itself indefinitely. You can accomplish this by creating an ‘if’ statement that prevents the statement from looping back into recursion when certain conditions are met. </p>
		<p>When recursion is useful<br>Recursion is great for problems that can be broken down into a single, repeatable sub-task. A recursive statement can cruise through the task over and over again until it reaches the base case and is completed.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is an exceptionally basic overview of recursion, and I look forward to learning more about this technique in the future. Until then, I’ll examine whether or not recursion is a valuable tool in my projects from now on.
