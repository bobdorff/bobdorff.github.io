     I'm going to tell you about a world without fear where you can experiment to your heart's content without ever feeling like you'll make a mistake that screws up all your work and makes you lose progress.
    </p> 
    <p>
    That sounds too good to be true, right?
    </p>
    <p>
    Crazily enough, this dreamworld where your mistakes go unpunished totally exists and it's all thanks to a process known as version control.
    </p>
   	<p>
    I am terrible at computer games, but that didn't stop me from playing too many of them as a boy. Rather than developing the hand-eye coordination necessary to successfully play these games, I crept through them inch by inch using save points. In old computer games, it's easy to pause the game, save your position in the level and hop back into the action. I saved my progress approximately every two minutes while playing those games, and my diligence meant that I never lost progress despite constantly dying.  
    </p>
    <p>
    Version control is kind of like that. 
    </p>
      <h3>
        Being in control
      </h3>
  	<p>
    When you use version control, you regularly save the project you're working on so you can return to that specific instance of its life at any time. When you save a document on your computer, you usually overwrite the document with each new save. That means you can't return to the copy of the document you saved three saves ago, because it no longer exists. With version control, all the different times you save a file stick around, and you can hop to any of them. That means you can't make permanent mistakes, because it's always possible to roll things back to an earlier state.
  </p>
  <p>

	It would be possible for you to make your own version control system by saving different copies of a file to your personal computer, but that's difficult, limiting and unncessary. Instead, you can use specially designed version control software that will automate a lot of the process and make your life easy. It's time to get git
  </p>

	<h3> 
  		Git in gear
	</h3>
  <p>
	Git is a piece of software that lives on your computer. You can use it to make and store copies of a file that you're working on. Whenever you want to save the current state of a file in git, you create a commit. A commit is like a snapshot of the file's current state. When you commit the changes you've made to a file, you're not necessarily overwriting an older version of the file. Git allows you to  on "branches" which are copies of the main project. When you work on a branch, you have access to all the information in the main project, but you don't run the risk of damaging the work you've already completed. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Commits save your progress on a branch. If you want to include the work you completed on a branch in the main project, you can, but the commit system ensures there are multiple copies of your work along the way. Each commit is a checkpoint, and you can always return to that spot if things get messed up later on.

  	<h3>
  	The other piece of the puzzle
	</h3>
  <p>
  Git lives on your local computer, but that's just one part of the equation. GitHub is a site that syncs with git to expand its functionality and truly harness the power of version control. 
  </p>
  <p>
	Every project in git is stored in a "repository" that contains all its relevant files. With GitHub, you can store these repositories on the Internet and share them with other people. This provides a ton of benefits for you as an individual developer and makes it way easier for large groups of people to work on a project together
  </p>
  <p>
	When your git repositories are stored online, you don't need to worry about a local storage failure destroying your work. That alone makes GitHub worthwhile, but it's just one part of the system's functionality. When you share a repository with other people, they're able to create clones of that repository that they can work on themselves. If they ever have changes they feel should be integrated back into the main project, they can submit them to the main repository. Those changes won't be automatically added to the project, however. Instead, a request will be posted that allows other people to view the changes. If those people think the changes belong in the main project, they can add them. Otherwise, the main project goes on untouched.
	</p>
	<p>
	This system makes it very easy for a huge number of people to work on a sprawling project without stepping on each others' toes and breaking everything all the time. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Basically, version control turns your work into a video game where you can save and restart from anywhere. When you combine that power with GitHub, you can safeguard your progess and let other people help you get a job done. It's pretty hard to argue against that.
