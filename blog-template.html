1. How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

Really enlightening. We took different directions with our wireframes, but the discussion forced each of us to reconsider different parts of our designs. We had a very smooth pairing experience, but our different approaches really pushed me to consider elements of design I wouldn't have thought about on my own. 

2. Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Wireframing has been useful so far. It really offers a safe space to mess around with different ideas prior to putting code in a computer. It was even more helpful to wireframe with another person, because they provided insight into how an outsider might interact with the site I had mocked up.

3. What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

A good wireframe is detailed enough to show how users will interact with the site, but doesn't get bogged down in any of the other aesthetic elements that will be incorporated into the final product. The lack of fine detail makes it easier to mess with elements, tear the site apart, and put it back together. 

4. What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I learned several new elements, because my pair is more experienced with HTML than I am. This template uses the <aside>, <nav>, and <main> tags.-->
